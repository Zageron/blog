## Hero Pedestal - Day 3

Alright, here's the final. It could be so much better, but the perspective on this sword and the resolution, make it exceptionally challenging.

I think next time I would forego borders completely.

## Thoughts on Borders

Borders in isometric seem to be very detrimental.
Considering the squash resolution it makes detail very challenging.

Will try my next piece with either shaded borders or no border at all.
