## Pixel Dailies

The prompt today was "wealth", so I decided to create a treasure chest.
I used the Ragnarok Online creep "mimic" as reference.

### Issues

- Gold is right at the lip of the chest, giving it a pretty flat feel.
- The outside is rather bland and poorly shaded, I hit the 1hr mark so I had to leave it.

Later gater.
