## Starting to try to learn People

Today was rough!
I started out by collecting a ton of reference material from Ragnarok Online.
Then I just went for it,
using some online resources for "how to draw humans".

I'm not tracing but I am working directly off of a set of examples.

Hopefully I can get some better form, or detail, tomorrow.
