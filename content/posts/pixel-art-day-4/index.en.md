## Day 4

I spent a huge chunk of time watching tutorials today.
Here are the videos I watched.

But first, the art I did today!

### Today's Art

#### Isometric Cloud Attempt

I attempted this cloud with no reference. It went _ok_?

Afterward, I attempted an isometric balloon.
It reads as a balloon, but I don't think I quite got the isometric perspective.

### Canvas Size

The canvas size thing was very interesting.
I ended up doing a bunch of calculations and came up with a set of pixel canvas sizes.

#### On-Screen Sprite Sizes: 16 x any number below 22

- 64 x 64 (Tiny 16x4)
- 80 x 80 (Small 16x5)
- 128 x 128 (Medium 16x8)
- 256 x 256 (Big 16x16)
- 320 x 320 (Large 16x20)
- 352 x 352 (Gargantuan 16x22 FullScreen)
- 704 x 704 (Argentintuan 16x44 Overscan)
- 1,072 x 1,072 (Titan 16x67 Overscan)

#### Maximum On-Screen Sprite Canvas Size

- 640 x 352

#### The Size Targets

Here's a big [_thing_](canvas-sprite-size-experimentation.png) I did in GIMP.

### Art Styles

During the process of watching this tutorial I get thinking about the art styles
that I wish to use in my project.
I believe I have settled,
or as much as I can settle,
on two distinctive styles.

- Take inspiration from Octopath Travellers backgrounds.
- Emulate the isometric spites from Ragnarok Online.

#### Octopath Examples
