## I lost my work :|

I made a stupid error today.
I wasn't saving consistently.
Something mucked up and I tried to fix it with asesprite's history tool,
but used it incorrectly and deleted all of my work.
Asesprite has a recovery system,
but it wasn't working correctly and the last backup was the last time I saved.

What a nightmare, lost about an hour of work.

### Caustic Reflections

Thankfully, I was streaming. So I was able to grab _something_.

Alright that's all for today, maybe I'll come back to this and redraw it.
At least I learned how to do water, as well as a reminder to save properly.
(I never do this with my code.
Next time I'm going to save and commit frequently in a branch.)
