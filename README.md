## Authoring a new Article

```pwsh
hugo new posts/name-of-article/index.en.md
```

### Pre-publish steps

1. Modify the publish date to the current time.
2. Append the timestamp, including the hour.
    - Ex. `posts/2022-01-01T00-name-of-article/index.en.md`

## Building and Deploying

From an elevated powershell run:

```pwsh
choco install hugo-extended -confirm
```

VSC should take care of everything after that.

See `.vscode/tasks.json` for details.
